DSA Visualizer (Java – Sorting Algorithms)

This is a console-based sorting visualizer built in Java. It shows each step of the sorting process with clear explanations, making it easier to understand how different sorting algorithms work internally.

Algorithms Implemented:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort

Technologies Used:
Java
Arrays
Loops
OOP concepts

Project Structure:
BubbleSort.java - Detailed bubble sort visualization
SelectionSort.java - Detailed selection sort visualization
InsertionSort.java - Detailed insertion sort visualization
Utils.java - Helper methods for printing arrays
Visualizer.java - Main file with menu for choosing sorting algorithm

How It Works:

The user chooses a sorting algorithm.

The user enters the number of elements and the elements themselves.

The program performs the sorting step by step.

Each comparison, swap, and movement is displayed on screen.

At the end, the sorted array is shown.

How To Run:
Step 1: Compile all files using
javac *.java
Step 2: Run the program using
java Visualizer

Sample Output:
Comparing 5 and 3
Swap
[3, 5, 1, 4]

Selecting minimum for position 0
Comparing 3 with current min 5
New minimum found
Swapping 5 and 3

Future Improvements:
Add Merge Sort and Quick Sort
Add search algorithm visualization
Add delay animations
Add file input and output support
